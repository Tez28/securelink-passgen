## Project Details

The Password Generator project shows the skills acquired working through module 4. In the application you will find html, css and javascript files
all making up the foundation of the application. 

## Functionality

Users when accessing the web page for my password generator will only be prompted once clicking the red Generate Password button. Once the button is clicked 
users will be prompted to select whether their password will be anywhere between 8 and 128 characters long. The password length is a requirement and users will
not be abkle to move forward without selecting a number in that range or they will receive an alert. Once the password length is selected users will be able to 
select whether they want their password to contain any combination of special characters, numbers, upper and lowercase letters, atleast 1 option must be selected. 
Once the user has met the requirements a password will be generated randomly for them.
